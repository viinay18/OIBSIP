Project Title: Data Cleaning Project
Description:
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and preparing a dataset for analysis. I worked with the New York City Airbnb Open Data (2019) to fix issues such as missing values, duplicates, and outliers, ensuring the data's accuracy, consistency, and reliability.

Dataset Overview:
Source: New York City Airbnb Open Data
Description: The dataset contains information about Airbnb listings in NYC, including property details, location, pricing, availability, and host details.
Key Steps:
Data Integrity: Ensured the dataset's accuracy and reliability.
Missing Data Handling:
Identified missing values using summary statistics.
Imputed or removed missing values based on their relevance.
Duplicate Removal:
Detected duplicate records.
Retained unique entries for accurate analysis.
Standardization:
Unified formatting for columns like price, availability, and location.
Ensured consistent data types across the dataset.
Outlier Detection:
Used visualization (box plots, histograms) to identify outliers.
Applied techniques to handle outliers appropriately.
