Project Title: Unveiling the Android App Market: Analyzing Google Play Store Data

Description:
This project focuses on cleaning, categorizing, and analyzing Google Play Store data to gain insights into app market dynamics. The analysis highlights app distributions, ratings, pricing trends, and user sentiments, providing a comprehensive understanding of the Android app market.

Dataset Overview:
Source: Google Play Store Dataset
Structure: Includes app names, categories, ratings, sizes, reviews, installs, prices, and user sentiments.

Detailed Key Steps:
1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Inspected key columns (e.g., categories, ratings, prices, sizes) to identify anomalies and trends.
Used statistical summaries (mean, median) and visualizations (bar charts, scatter plots) to uncover patterns.

2) Handling Missing Values:
Identified missing values in critical columns.
Applied appropriate imputation techniques for numeric fields like ratings and reviews.
Dropped irrelevant rows with excessive missing data to maintain dataset quality.

3) Duplicate Records Removal:
Removed duplicate entries based on unique app identifiers to ensure data accuracy.

4) Standardization and Formatting:
Normalized key columns (e.g., category names, pricing) to maintain consistency.
Standardized data types for numerical and categorical fields.

5) Outlier Detection and Treatment:
Used visualizations (boxplots, histograms) to identify outliers in size and price.
Applied capping and exclusion methods to handle extreme values.

6) Sentiment Analysis:
Analyzed user reviews to extract sentiment scores.
Identified correlations between user sentiments and app ratings.

7) Interactive Visualization:
Created dashboards and visual representations of market trends using advanced visualization techniques.

Outcome:
A well-prepared and analyzed dataset that uncovers app market trends, highlights category performance, and provides actionable insights into user preferences and market dynamics. This supports data-driven decision-making in app development and marketing strategies.
